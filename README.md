## Layout/Observations

In total, there are approximately 40 models used in this project. We created the TV, Fireplace, Bar, Pool Table, Light Switch, and all of the House Exterior.

### Stair Functionality

As we have not quite gone over physics within VR environments, there was a problem in navigating to the second floor of the house. As a quick solution, we created a model that the user can interact with to change the positioning of the camera. This created a "teleport" effect in where the user is lifted to the second floor of the house.
