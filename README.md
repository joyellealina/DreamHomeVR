### Stair Functionality
As we have not quite gone over physics within VR environments, there was a problem in navigating to the second floor of the house. As a quick solution, we created a model that the user can interact with to change the positioning of the camera. This created a "teleport" effect in where the user is lifted to the second floor of the house.
